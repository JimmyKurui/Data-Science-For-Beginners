## Write A Data Ethics Case Study

## Instructions

You've learned about various [Data Ethics Challenges](README.md#2-ethics-challenges) and seen some examples of [Case Studies](README.md#3-case-studies) reflecting data ethics challenges in real-world contexts.

In this assignment, you'll write your own case study reflecting a data ethics challenge from your own experience, or from a relevant real-world context you are familiar with. Just follow these steps:

1. `Pick a Data Ethics Challenge`. Look at [the lesson examples](README.md#2-ethics-challenges) or explore online examples like [the Deon Checklist](https://deon.drivendata.org/examples/) to get inspiration.

2. `Describe a Real World Example`. Think about a situation you have heard of (headlines, research study etc.) or experienced (local community), where this specific challenge occurred. Think about the data ethics questions related to the challenge - and discuss the potential harms or unintended consequences that arise because of this issue. Bonus points: think about potential solutions or processes that may be applied here to help eliminate or mitigate the adverse impact of this challenge.

3. `Provide a Related Resources list`. Share one or more resources (links to an article, a personal blog post or image, online research paper etc.) to prove this was a real-world occurrence. Bonus points: share resources that also showcase the potential harms & consequences from the incident, or highlight positive steps taken to prevent its recurrence.



## Rubric

Exemplary | Adequate | Needs Improvement
--- | --- | -- |
One or more data ethics challenges are identified. <br/> <br/> The case study clearly describes a real-world incident reflecting that challenge, and highlights undesirable consequences or harms it caused. <br/><br/> There is at least one linked resource to prove this occurred. | One data ethics challenge is identified. <br/><br/> At least one relevant harm or consequence is discussed briefly. <br/><br/> However discussion is limited or lacks proof of real-world occurence. | A data challenge is identified. <br/><br/> However the description or resources do not adequately reflect the challenge or prove it's real-world occurence. |

## Safaricom Data Breach: A Case Study of Data Security Challenge
In 2020, Safaricom, a Kenyan telecom suffered a data leak that led to leaking and circulation of personal information of over 11.5 million subscribers to anauthorized individuals. Was this data protected against leaks and breaches? Yes, Safaricom took steps to ensure that customer data is protected. In regards to access, only authorized users are allowed which is where security was breached. Following investigation, it was found that senior officials collaborated to leak data with the aim of selling it to 3rd parties. Anonymity was not preserved in transfering the data although de-identification is guarded against in the Safaricom system. 
- Users that had used their lines were exposed in the leak and the culprits sold to betting companies, which led to message spamming on an unsolicited scale. With data still in circulation some secondary effects include: A number of possible harms include: Scamming from exploiting personal information, safety threats from location, name and ID use. Targeted sales based on income levels is also another problem.
- Possible solutions to this include regular audits of authorised users and multi-factor process checks to verify data control.
